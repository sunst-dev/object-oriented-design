# Parking Lot Design

## Problem Overview
Design a flexible parking lot system that can track available spaces, support multiple vehicle types, and provide reliable entry/exit operations. The lot spans multiple levels (floors), each containing a mix of compact, large, and motorcycle spots. Drivers should be able to see whether a spot is available, enter, park, pay, and exit with minimal friction, while attendants need an overview of occupancy.

Key requirements:
- Handle cars, motorcycles, and large vehicles with different spot sizing rules.
- Track availability per floor and across the entire facility in real time.
- Support ticketing for entry/exit, including pricing based on parking duration.
- Provide administrative hooks for reserving spots and marking areas as closed for maintenance.
