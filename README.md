# Object-Oriented Design Examples

This repository collects object-oriented design examples organized by topic. Each example lives in its own folder so you can focus on one concept or pattern at a time.

## Repository Goals
- Demonstrate practical OOD patterns and principles in small, focused code samples.
- Provide step-by-step evolution of designs to illustrate tradeoffs and refactoring techniques.
- Serve as a reference library you can revisit when tackling similar problems.

## How This Repo Is Organized
- Each top-level directory contains a self-contained example.
- Examples include a problem description, design discussion, and implementation.
- Tests and supporting materials live alongside the example code where relevant.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore the folders that match the pattern you are interested in (e.g., design patterns, SOLID principles, modeling exercises).
3. Follow the README or notes inside each folder to understand the problem and solution.

## Contributing
Have an interesting OOD example to share? Open a pull request with:
- A new folder named after the concept or problem.
- A README explaining the scenario and design approach.
- Sample code and tests demonstrating the solution.

## License
Add licensing details here if you plan to share or reuse the examples.
